# Court Order Document Analyzer

Transform complex court orders into accessible and understandable information using LangGraph. This tool performs classification, entity extraction, and summarization to simplify legal content for both experts and non-experts.

---

## 📌 **Overview**
The Court Order Document Analyzer is a modular, multi-step text analysis pipeline tailored for legal documents. Using LangGraph, the tool processes court orders through three key stages: classification, entity extraction, and summarization.

---

## 🚀 **Features**

### 1. **Text Classification**
Categorizes court orders into predefined legal categories:
- Civil Cases  
- Criminal Cases  
- Family Law  
- Administrative Cases  

This step helps quickly identify the context of each order.

### 2. **Entity Extraction**
Extracts key legal entities from court orders, including:
- **Parties Involved:** Identifies plaintiffs and defendants  
- **Case Numbers:** Extracts unique case identifiers  
- **Dates:** Highlights important dates  
- **Legal Terms:** Recognizes key legal terminology  

### 3. **Text Summarization**
Generates concise, plain-language summaries of court orders, making complex legal language accessible to non-experts.

## 🛠️ **Architecture**
- **LangGraph Framework:** Manages step-by-step workflows  
- **Classification Module:** Categorizes text based on predefined legal categories  
- **Entity Extraction Module:** Utilizes NLP techniques to extract structured information  
- **Summarization Module:** Converts complex text into an easy-to-understand summary
